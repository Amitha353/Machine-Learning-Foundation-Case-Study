## 1.Predicting house prices (Regression Model to Predict House Prices)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* X -> feature, covariant, predictor, independent;
* Y -> observation, response, dependent;

#### Linear Regression Model (Fit a line through the model)
* fw(x) = w0 + w1*x; (w0 -> Intercept; w1 -> slope; parametrized function w = (w0,w1))
* Various lines are fit into the dataset and the line with mininum RSS cost is choosen.
* RSS(Residual Sum of Error) : The line is fit throught the dataset, and check how far the observation is from what the model predicted (fitted model).
